            <p class="pl-3">
              His priestly gestures, consecrating the broken eggs,<br>
              hands moving over the stove, slabs of meat
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              skittering in grease, drop biscuits big as a cat’s<br>
              head, threaded with cheese.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              Him, making the fountain, making lantana, acanthus,<br>
              making bloom and ripple, song, making the birds.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              My husband, the blue room, the bright room, best china,<br>
              best silver lifted from a box in the closet,
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              its red beds of best silver, put back later for later.<br>
              My husband who is not my husband who is still mine.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              See him, crying in the Dublin airport—<br>
              he doesn’t want you to see. Can you see
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              the eucomis, its waxy leaves, its stalk blossoming<br>
              in the hot sun, pushing up among the marigolds?
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              Scars from this or that on shin or back, wrist or hand,<br>
              the way the garden loves him, the bees.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              Him among the lilies, his hands lilies, his mouth<br>
              a twist of quince, his scent.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              My husband among the lilies.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              My husband, sauntering down the aisles. Him, sauntering<br>
              down the aisles at the flea market, dust settling
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              on everything, his small flashlight, his blue eyes,<br>
              his sound of geese, a train. Look,
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              something glitters and is gone. My husband, the gold<br>
              in the trees, falling, and him, a coverlet of mulch
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              across the beds, or asleep, the heat of him,<br>
              the hot water bottle of him, the cat purring at our feet.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-3">
              My husband who is not my husband who is still mine.<br>
              The blue walls say so, the orchid deciding to bloom again.
